## Here is my code.

    var name = "Abhishek Baliyan";
    let age = 26;

Another way but best way.

```js
const gender = "Male";
console.log(`My name is ${name}. I'm ${age} year old ${gender}.`);
```

Here is example of inline code `var a = 10;`

## Github Diff example

```diff
var a = 10;
- var x = 20;
+ var x = 32;
```
